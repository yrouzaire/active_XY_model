    #= A few remarks on the previous line :
        1. Julia can deal with 1/0 = Inf and any number is smaller than Inf
            so no problem with the divisions
        2. The first term (π/10max) is here to ensure that the oscillator
            with the max frequency will be resolved correctly. It grows as sqrt(logN).
        3. The second term should have been π/40 to ensure that the greater
            possible coupling (when each one of all 4 neighbours produces a
            unit coupling). Since this situation only happens at very high T°,
            that it will basically never occur, I chose to relax this upper bound
            to π/20. It's more of a guardrail in case of very small σ AND very
            small T.
        4. The last term is obtained by getting the expectation value of the
            absolute value of the noise ξ, leading to sqrt(π/T)/2. Remember that
            it is sqrt(dt) and not dt alone that enters the Euler Maryuama integrator.
            It is the more constraining term for usual ranges of \sigma and T.
        5. The overall coefficient π/10 is arbitrary and can be modulated as desired.

    one order of complexity above the other methods, which are usually O(L^2).
    This is why I chose not to implement other approximations for the euclidian
    distance r, which would have pleasantly refined its discretization.
    There are a lot of other possibilities : i.e. the displacement of a cavalier
    in a chess game. But already there, the combinatorics begin to increase
    (8 possibilities). Implementing more and more of these would let the complexity
    go up to  O(L^4). =#

    #= Note 3 : One may remark that the output is an average of averages. In this
    particular case, it is totally correct because all the sub-samples are of the
    same size. Note that this is another argument is favour of not computing other
    types of discretized distances. =#

@everywhere function classify_vortices(thetas::Matrix{Float64})
    #= Let's sum up what this function does. Characterising a vortex pair as free
    or bounded is not a trivial question, be it numerically or conceptually.
    There currently exists no precise definition in the litterature and what follows
    does not pretend to be a definitive one. The underlying idea is to OPTIMALLY
    pair the vortices with their closest opposite-polarity neighbour, optimal in
    the sense that the total distance between pairs should be minimized.
    Then, we define a pair as free if its distance is above a given threshold,
    and as bounded if below that threshold. If one decides to reason in terms of
    distances to classify pairs of vortices, I reckon this optimal bipartite matching
    is the only valid solution. Any of the other simpler procedures I've tried led to
    incoherences, at least when visually checking the results.

    To carry out the bipartite optimal matching, we use the so-called Hungarian Matching algoritm,
    also called Munkres' algoritm after James Munkres, the first to have proved that the
    complexity of this algo was not actually exponential as thought until then, but rather
    polynomial : O(m^3) where m is the number of vortex pairs. (for the record, he showed
    it was O(m^4) and the bound was lowered in the 70's).
    Note 1 : m = O(L²) is the worst-case (high T and/or high σ²), leading the algorithm
        to be O(L^6) in the worst-case. =#

    L = size(thetas)[1]

    list_vortex,list_antivortex  = spot_vortex_antivortex(thetas) # Vector{Tuple{Int,Int}}
    m = length(list_vortex) # number of pairs vortex/antivortex

    # Labels
        # label = 0  : free vortex
        # label ≥ 1  : bounded vortex, each pair has a unique ID (the token) ≥ 1
    label_vortex = fill(-1,m) ; label_antivortex = fill(-1,m)
    token = 1

    #= Now comes the tricky question of what distance should we choose as
    threshold to determine whether a vortex pair is bounded or not. Let's dare the
    crude approximation that the pairs of vortices are uniformly distributed on
    the square.
    Let's consider the behaviour only at large L (actually, I reckon that this second
    approximation should be more controlled in a periodic lattice).
    Based on the first answer by Douglas Zare on mathoverflow.net/questions/124579
    the average minimal distance between each one of the m/2 pairs is of the order of 2/m.
    Since if the threshold is too large, one will never end up with free vortices
    classified as such, let's divide for security this threshold by a factor two,
    leading to threshold_dist = 1/m (here for a unit square -> L/m for a LxL lattice.)

    Note 2 : the threshold distance decreases exponentially with T and/or σ² since
        the number of vortices increases exponentially.
    Note 3 : since m = O(L²) is the worst-case, one has to manually ensure that
        the threshold does not decrease too much. Here comes in the first arbitrary
        parameter, namely that constant in the max. Indeed, we observe in the simulations
        that vortices that one would intuitively consider as bounded can very well diffuse
        (on distance of the order of a few lattice-spacings) due to random thermal
        fluctuations.
        The value 3 is justified thanks to the benchmarks, showing that for ≤ 2 and ≥ 5
        it produces poor results (L=200 , R=30 , tmax=500) =#
